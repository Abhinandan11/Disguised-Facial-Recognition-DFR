- Training:
	Regression(for facial key-point detection):
	- Run **model.py**.
	- It will give two files named **model.h5** and **model.json**.
	- For retraining, run 'retrain.py'.
- Testing:
	- For taking predictions from model, run **loadModel.py**, which will give **predictions.csv**.
	- **GiveAnglesRatios.py** will give angles and ratios of any file given as input.
	
`Contact **abhinandan_17btech15@nitsri.ac.in** to get **model.h5**.`
